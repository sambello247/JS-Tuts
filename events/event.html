        /* 
            An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

            Here are some examples of HTML events:

            An HTML web page has finished loading
            An HTML input field was changed
            An HTML button was clicked
            Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

            JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
